welcome  to my page！

🌱 My name is Qi, i am currently an undergraduate student pursing a second bachelor's in computer science.My first degree was in plant protection.（My teacher told me before " we are going to train you to become a Plant Doctor" but i konw that not a really docter,so i quit )

🤔 I upload my code from my studies to GitHub, as well as write articles in the issues section of GitHub to document the challenges, joys, difficulties, and insights I encounter during my learning process.

 👯 I enjoy communication and welcome any thoughts or ideas you may have, so please feel free to leave me a message. I enjoy writing and expressing myself through recording my thoughts, and I hope to quickly master the art of expressing myself through code.


🔭 I don't know who can read these in futher,maybe nobody. I don't know what should i write in this.....

👯 So， I just see this note,this github space, and all my repositories as my traces in the internet.

 Maybe some day,some one visit here, just say: Hi,there ,welecome here!

🌱 欢迎来到我的Github，但我不确定该用什么来准确的描述我:)

🤔 经常看有人自我介绍时会像论文中keyword 关键词一样给自己打几个标签，介绍一下自己。我暂时还不想用几个关键词来描述我自己，毕竟评价自己这种事情，自己写多少有点不讲究，太高或太低的评价，自己或他人总有一方不服气的。

⚡ by the way,喜欢村上春树（或许仅仅是喜欢 村上春树=林少华译？"true love":"not really love"），《百年孤独》倒是反反复复看了几遍，此外读的书不多，热爱老大哥（if 2+2=5），喜欢做有趣的事情，听B.B的歌,喜欢记录做项目的过程，于是写了很多到issue，也把issue当成了博客来写。（这有点不讲究？）

🔭 代码水平不算高，前端不精通，Vue用的不算熟，目前在学习python，搞一个背单词的毕设。

    倒是更喜欢我写的[issue](https://github.com/QiYongchuan/Hope_Love/issues/1#issue-1741285946),有种看小说中情节发展的感觉。
