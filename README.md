welcome  to my page！

🌱 My name is Qi, i am currently an undergraduate student pursing a second bachelor's in computer science.My first degree was in plant protection.

🤔 I upload my code from my studies to GitHub, as well as write articles in the issues section of GitHub to document the challenges, joys, difficulties, and insights I encounter during my learning process.

 👯 I enjoy communication and welcome any thoughts or ideas you may have, so please feel free to leave me a message. I enjoy writing and expressing myself through recording my thoughts, and I hope to quickly master the art of expressing myself through code.


🔭 I don't know who can read these in futher,maybe nobody. I don't know what should i write in this.....

👯 So， I just see this note,this github space, and all my repositories as my traces in the internet.

 Maybe some day,some one visit here, just say: Hi,there ,welecome here!

🌱 欢迎来到我的Github，但我不确定该用什么来准确的描述我:)

🤔 经常看有人自我介绍时会像论文中keyword 关键词一样给自己打几个标签，介绍一下自己。我不太自信我能找到这样准确描述我的关键词，毕竟我毕设论文的关键词我始终以为是在虚张声势。

⚡ 或许有一天AI能帮我准确自我评价吧

🔭 我不知道将来谁会来到这里，
